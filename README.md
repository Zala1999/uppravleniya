Abstract

“HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is software developed for managing various activities in the hostel. For the past few  years  the numbers of educational institutions are increasing rapidly. Thereby the numbers of hostels are also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution.  And  hence  there is a lot of strain on the person who are running the hostel and  software’s  are  not  usually used in this context. This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually.

Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads   to  the designing of computerized system that will be compatible to the existing system with the system which  is more users friendly and more GUI oriented.


  #Introduction
	#PROBLEM DEFINITION
This system is designed  in  favor  of  the  hostel management  which  helps  them  to  save  the  records of the students about their rooms  and  other  things.  It  helps  them  from  the  manual  work  from which it is very difficult to  find  the  record  of  the  students  and  the  mess  bills  of  the  students,  and the information of about the those ones who had left the  hostel.  All  the  hostels  at  present  are managed manually by the hostel office. The Registration form verification to the  different  data processing is done manually. Thus there are a lot of repetitions  which  can be easily avoided. And  hence there is a lot of strain on the  person  who  are  running  the  hostel  and  software’s  are  not usually used in this context. This particular  project  deals  with  the  problems  on  managing  a  hostel and avoids the problems  which  occur  when  carried  manually  Identification  of  the  drawbacks  of  the existing system leads to the designing of computerized system that will  be  compatible  to  the existing system with  the  system  which  is  more  user  friendly.  We  can  improve  the  efficiency  of the system, thus overcome the drawbacks of the  existing  system.  We  design  this  system  of  the hostel management especially for the college hostel, through this they cannot require so efficient person to handle and  calculate  the  things.  This  system  automatically  calculates  all  the  bills  and issued the notifications for those students who are against some rules.

	#OBJECTIVES OF PROJECT

This software product the hostel management to improve their services  for  all  the  students  of the hostel. This also reduce the manual work   of  the  persons   in  admin  penal  and  the  bundle  of registers that  were  search  when  to  find  the  information  of  a  previous  student,  because  through  this system you can store  the  data  of those  students  who  had  left  the  hostel  .  Through  this  you can check the personal profile of all the current students within few minutes the  data  base  of the system will help you  to  check  a  particular  one.  The  system will  help  you  to  check  the  mess  bills of every student and the student’s  hostel dues.  The  students  of the  hostel will  be recognized  from the ID number allocated at the room rental  time.  In  the  last  this  system  will  improve  the management work in the hostel.

•	To automate each and every activity of the manual system, which increases its throughput

•	To provide a quick response with very accurate information as and when required
•	To make the present manual system more interactive, speedy and user friendly
•	To avail any information, whatever and whenever needed
•	Reduce the cost of maintenance


System Analysis & Design
The way that is followed while carrying on with the development application is as follows:

Defining problem

Defining a problem is one of the important activities of the project. The objective is to define precisely the business problem to be solved & thereby determined the scope of the new system. This phase consist of 2 main tasks. The 1st task within this activity is to review the organization needs that originally initiated the project. The 2nd task is to identify, at an abstract or general level, the expected capabilities of the new system. Thus, it helps us to define the goal to be achieved & the boundary of the system. A clear understanding of the problem will help us in building a better system & reduce the risk of project failure. It also specifies the resources that have to be made available to the project. Three important factors project goal, project bounds & the resource limits are sometimes called the project’s term of reference.

Feasibilitystudy

The systems objectives outlined during the feasibility study serve as the basic from which the work of system design is initiated. Much of the activities involved at this stage is of technical nature requiring a certain degree of experience in designing systems, sound knowledge of computer related technology and through understanding of computers available in the market and the various facilities provided by the vendors. Nevertheless, a system cannot be designed in isolation without the active involvement of the user. The user has a vital role to play at this stage too. As we know that data collected during feasibility study wills we utilized systematically during the system design. It should, however be kept in mind that detailed study of the existing system is not necessarily over with the completion of the feasibility study. Depending on the plan of feasibility study, the level of detailed study will vary and the system designstagewillalsovaryintheamountofinvestigationthatstillneedstobedone.
 
This investigation is generally an urgent activity during the system. Sometimes, but rarely, this investigation may form a separate stage between feasibility study and computer system design. Designing a new system is a creative process, which calls  for logical as well as lateral thinking. The logical approach involves systematic moves towards the end product keeping in mind the capabilities of the personnel and the equipment at each decision making step. Lateral thought implies encompassing of ideas beyond the usual functions and equipment. This is to ensure that no efforts are being made to fit previous solutions into newsituations.
The feasibility study proposes one or more conceptual solutions to the problem set for the project. The objective in assessing feasibility is to determine whether a development project has a reasonable chance of success. It helps us to determine the input & output of the system. The following are the criteria that are considered to confirm the project feasibility.

The following feasibility study was undertaken for the proposed system:


Technical feasibility:
At first it’s necessary to check that the proposed system is technically feasible or not & to determine the technology and skill necessary to carry out the project. If they are not available then find out the solution to obtain them. Hardware is already available in theUniversity.

Economic feasibility:
While considering economic feasibility, it is checked in points like performance, information and outputs from the system. The developing system must be justified by cost and benefit. Criteria to ensure that effort is concentrated on project , which will give best , return at the earliest. One of the factors , which affect the development of   a new system , is the cost it would require.

Social feasibility:
Although generally there is always resistance, initially to any change in the system is aimed at reliving the work load of the users to extent the system is going to facilitate user to perform
Operations like calculating salary amounts and deductions, generating reports with less possible errors. Thus there is no reason to make system sociallyunfeasible.

Modules & Features

Module

There are two basic modules in this system as describe briefly in below
•	Administrative module: This user is an admin type who has full rights on the system.


AdministrativeModule


This module includes storing and retrieving the details of the data.

System Implementation

5.1	ImplementationMethodology

We follow the MVC design pattern for developing our system. Model–view– controller (MVC) is a software design pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from theuser.

•	Model: The model manages the behavior and data of the application domain, responds to requests for information about its state (usually from the view), and responds to instructions to change state (usually from thecontroller).
•	View: The view manages the display ofinformation.
•	Controller: The controller interprets the mouse and keyboard inputs from the user, informing the model and/or the view to change asappropriate.

 
5.2	Data FlowDiagram
A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the "flow" of data through an information system, modeling its process aspects. A DFD is often used as a preliminary step to create an overview of the system, which can later be elaborated.[2] DFDs can also be used for the visualization of data processing.
A DFD shows what kind of information will be input to and output from the system, where the data will come from and go to, and where the data will be stored. It does not show information about the timing of process or information about whether processes will operate in sequence or in parallel.

An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a graphical representation of an information system that shows the relationship between people, objects, places, concepts or events within that system. In software engineering an ER model is commonly formed to represent things that a business needs to remember in order to perform business processes. Consequently, the ER model becomes an abstract data model that defines a data or information structure that can be implemented in a database, typically a relational database.
An ER model is typically implemented as a database. In a simple relational database implementation, each row of a table represents one instance of an entity type, and each field in a table represents an attribute type. In a relational database a relationship between entities is implemented by storing the primary key of one entity as a pointer or "foreign key" in the table of anotherentity.
There is a tradition for ER/data models to be built at two or three levels of abstraction. Note that the conceptual-logical-physical hierarchy below is used in other kinds of specification, and is different from the three schema approach to software engineering.


#Normalization


Database Normalization is a technique of organizing the data in the database. Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form by removing duplicated data from the relation tables.
•	Normalization is used for mainly twopurpose,
•	Eliminating redundant (useless)data.
Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e. data is logically stored.
Without Normalization, it becomes difficult to handle and update the database, without facing data loss. Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies are very frequent if Database is notnormalized.
Normalization rule are divided into following normal form.
•	First NormalForm
•	Second NormalForm
•	Third NormalForm
•	BCNF
As per First Normal Form, no two Rows of data must contain repeating group of information i.e each set of column must have a unique value, such that multiple columns cannot be used to fetch the same row. Each table should be organized into rows, and each row should have a primary key that distinguishes it as unique.
As per First Normal Form, there are no repeating or duplicate fields in our database and each cell contains only a single value. For example.
As per First Normal Form, there are no repeating or duplicate fields in our database. Our system database does not have any column that has multiple repeating values. So our system database table is in first normal form.
As per Second Normal Form, Second normal form states that it should meet all the rules for 1NF and there must be no partial dependences of any of the columns on the primary key:
Let’s check with another table of our database:

From the above table we can say it meets all the rules for 1NF and there is no column that depends on the primary key. SO our database table is also in Second Normal Form.
In Third Normal Form, it should meet all the rules for 2NF and no non-key fields can depend upon another.
But from the above table we see, there is dependencies on two non-key value shift_id and shift_title . Shift title depends on shift id. So our system database table is not in 3NF.
